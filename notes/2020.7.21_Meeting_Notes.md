* Dicsussed the part numbering system slava is working on.  The idea is to have a service that will tale a part type and a list of parameters.  Service will look up to see if there is an existing part.  If there is, that part number is returned.  If not, it will be entered and the id of the newly entered part is returned.
* Discussed the dynamic loading of parameters.  The Sketchit app is a perfect example.  It appears that in the request we can add additional data to the payload json.  This should be available in .NET through the DesignAutomation library via DesignAutomationData object.
* Raul has been making some progress with Inventor
* For remaining work, proposed planning on splitting up the work like this.
    * Louis to update the add in to dynamically place walls and floors
        *  Louis needs a sample XML to begin working.  Aaron or Micah to provide.
